# poolpulse
Privacy-first lane busyness for Edinburgh Leisure pools (pilot: Leith Victoria, Glenogle, Royal Commonwealth).

**Pilot pools:** Leith Victoria, Glenogle, Royal Commonwealth  
**Lane model:** Fast / Medium / Slow  
**Signals:** Verified check-ins (OTP for contributors), aggregated and auto-expiring.

## Why
Lane crowding is one of the most frustrating parts of pool swimming. PoolPulse helps swimmers decide **when to go** and **which lane type to choose**.

## Privacy
No cameras. No surveillance. No location tracking. Aggregated busyness only.
