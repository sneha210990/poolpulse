# Privacy

PoolPulse is privacy-first.

## What we collect
- Anonymous check-ins: pool ID, lane type, `delta`, and timestamp.
- Optional feedback submissions: feedback type, message, and optional contact email if provided.
- Basic technical logs from hosting/infrastructure providers for security and operations.

## What we do NOT collect
- No camera/biometric surveillance.
- No precise location tracking or background GPS collection.
- No mandatory account/profile data required to browse pool busyness or submit check-ins.
- No public display of user-level identity/activity.

## How data is shown
- Aggregated busyness by lane type (Fast/Medium/Slow).
- Friendly ranges/labels (e.g., Quiet/Moderate/Busy), not exact headcounts.
- Busyness calculations use recent check-ins in a short-lived window (currently 75 minutes).
